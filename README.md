Building a zoo!

## Challenge

Build out the hierarchical class structure of a zoo. 
There are 3 layers of inheritance, the base class being Animal with 6 different concrete classes of animals.
The code displays in the console:
* 2 abstract methods overrides
* 2 abstract property overrides 
* 2 virtual method overrides
* 2 virtual property overrides 
* 2 classes implements 2 interfaces

An interface is a contract in which all classes inheriting the interface should follow.
Animal Class implements a sleep interface and the Crustacean Class implements a swim interface since these are actions relevant to these classes. For example, all animals sleep and all crustaceans "swim" (to some extent!).

## Solution
